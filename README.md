## Overview
This is a group project for UBC course *[STAT 545A](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/syllabus-545a/)*. The central objective is to learn git and GitHub workflow for working in a collaborative environment. Thus, the focus has been to work in branches as much as possible and have different members approve and merge requests. Project is bifurcated; progress as of 2<sup>th</sup> October 2021:

- [x] Milestone 1
  * Modifications to `README.md` and `TEAMWORK.md` files.
  * Merged pull requests of branches.
  * Fixed errors on `troubleshooting-1.rmd`.
  * Made GitHub issues.
  * Created a release for this milestone. 
- [x] Milestone 2
  * Modifications to `README.md` file.
  * Merged pull requests of branches.
  * Fixed errors on `troubleshooting-2.rmd`
  * Created a release for this milestone. 
  

## Project Files
1. *[Team Contract](/TEAMWORK.md)*: Delineates expectations and some agreed upon ground rules for the team.
2. *[Troubleshooting1](/troubleshooting-1.md)*: This file originally contained the broken `R` code for the first milestone, which was corrected as part of assignment.
3. *[Troubleshooting2](/troubleshooting-2.md)*: This file originally contained the broken `R` code for the second milestone, which was corrected as part of assignment.

## Code execution
The corrected code can be run from files *[Troubleshooting-1](/troubleshooting-1.Rmd)* and *[Troubleshooting-2](/troubleshooting-2.Rmd)* using `R` software along with additional packages such as `tidyverse`, `dslabs`, etc. Using an IDE such as `RStudio` carries out this task easily.
