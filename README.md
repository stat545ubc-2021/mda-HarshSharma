## Overview
This is a individual project for UBC course *[STAT 545A](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/syllabus-545a/)*. The central objective is to perform exploratory data analysis using R and GitHub workflow. The focus is to perform the analysis using best practices for clean code writing, reproducibility, and thinking clarity in order to impact and engage the reader productively. Project is trifurcated; progress as of 28<sup>th</sup> October 2021:

- [x] Mini data analysis 1
  * Glancing different datasets and choosing one through iteratively exploration
  * Familiarization with chosen data set
  * Articulating 4 research questions around the chosen data set
- [x] Mini data analysis 2
  * Manipulating and summarizing data
  * Tidying and untidying data
  * Effectively refine and answer research questions
- [x] Mini data analysis 3
  * Refining results
  * Manipulating special data types
  * Reading and writing data to files
  

## Project Folders and Files
The project has four main folders. Files are located in their respective folders for the three milestones. The *[Output](/Output)* folder stores saved data. Important files are:
1. *[MDA1](/Milestone1/MDA1.md)*: Report1 rendered in Github friendly format.
2. *[MDA1.rmd](/Milestone1/MDA1.rmd)*: Corresponding file containing the `R` code for the report1 analysis.
3. *[MDA2](/Milestone2/MDA2.md)*: Report2 rendered in Github friendly format.
4. *[MDA2.rmd](/Milestone2/MDA2.rmd)*: Corresponding file containing the `R` code for the report2 analysis.
5. *[MDA3](/Milestone3/MDA3.md)*: Report3 rendered in Github friendly format.
6. *[MDA3.rmd](/Milestone3/MDA3.rmd)*: Corresponding file containing the `R` code for the report3 analysis.

## Code execution
The corrected code for final report can be run from files *[MDA3](/Milestone3/MDA3.Rmd)* using `R` software along with additional packages such as `tidyverse`, `devtools`, and specifically  `datateacher`. Using an IDE such as `RStudio` carries out this task easily.
