```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Overview
This report continues the exploratory data analysis performed in Report 1 and 2 on the 'cancer_dataset' chosen from the `datateacher` package. Incremental effort will be placed in exploring in more detail the dataset in a fashion that will lead to generating insights to answer the research questions.

## Set-up
First we need to load the following two packages:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Installing packages if missing, required only once
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/datateachr")

#library(datateachr)
#library(tidyverse)
```

## Task1: Processing and Summarizing Data
