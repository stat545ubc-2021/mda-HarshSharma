## Overview

This report continues the exploratory data analysis performed in Report
1 and 2 on the ‘cancer\_dataset’ chosen from the `datateacher` package.
Incremental effort will be placed in exploring in more detail the
dataset in a fashion that will lead to generating insights to answer the
research questions.

## Set-up

First we need to load the following two packages:

``` r
# Installing packages if missing, required only once
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/datateachr")

#library(datateachr)
#library(tidyverse)
```
